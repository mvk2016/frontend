#Static Demo

To keep things simple our development server will just be:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

which serves static files, from the current directory, on `localhost:8000`. This of course requires a python installation. SimpleHTTPServer is a module in the standard library, so if you already have a python installation you are good to go!

This demo uses mock data that is stored in the api directory.

Yes, it is ugly.
